# workspaces
Open source browser workspace manager

Workspaces lets you manage sets of tabs and windows for your browser, straight from the command line. Some of the use cases include restarting the computer or browser, being able to painlessly switch between workspaces and keeping things tidy.

The source code, as well as a more extensive readme, is currently being developed.
